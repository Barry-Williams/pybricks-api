Pybricks API Documentation
==================================================================

`Pybricks <https://pybricks.com/>`_ is Python coding for smart LEGO速 hubs.
Run MicroPython scripts
directly on the hub, and get full control of your motors and sensors.

Pybricks runs on LEGO速 BOOST, City, Technic, MINDSTORMS速, and SPIKE速. You can
code using Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook, and Android.

          `EV3 documentation`_ instead.


**Installation**

To run Pybricks MicroPython scripts, you must update the firmware on the hub.
To get started, click one of the platforms below.
